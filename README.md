Author: Krystan Menne

I used these projects to learn various skills in Python.

## Files Included

**dog_adventure.py**

This is a choose your own adventure game,
based on [Learn Python the Hard Way Exercise 45](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex45.html).

**bship.py**

This is a Battleship game based on [Codecademy's battleship assignment](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-en-4XuFm/0/1).
You have ten turns to find and sink a one-character long battleship.

**solver.py**

This is a Scrabble cheater based on [O'Reilly Introduction to Python/Section 18'](https://openhatch.org/wiki/O'Reilly_Introduction_to_Python/Section_18).
To run, supply the letters from your rack on the command line, as shown in the following example:
```
python solver.py KRYSTAN
```
The program creates a list of anagrams and checks their validity in the sowpods.txt Scrabble dictionary.
It then sorts valid anagrams into the number of points they are worth in Scrabble, prioritizing shorter words that gain higher points.
